#------------------------------------------------PREREQUISITES-----------------------------------------------#
1) You need Google Chrome installed. PhotoStream does not support Firefox.
	Installing chrome from a deb package =>
	$ sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_i386.deb

I've included a copy of Chrome.

2) You must be signed into facebook before you run PhotoStream.

3) you must manually install 2 Perl modules via Cpan.
	*Buntu =>
	$ sudo su
	$ cpan 
	$ reload cpan
	$ install Tk
	$ install Facebook::Graph
	$ reload cpan
	$ exit

4) Run perl Makefile.PL and your set. The way to run the program is to launch the UI from the command line. 

Then exit the super user environment so you may go into the normal user environment due to the fact that you 
should not run Chrome as super user. There are preventive measures put in place to prevent this in the first place. 
Just trying to save you some time.

Launch PhotoStream with =>
	$ perl PhotoStream.pm 

See USAGE at the bottom.

#-------------------------------------------------DEPENDENCIES-----------------------------------------------#

# Library prerequesites. If they are not present, PhotoStream will not work.
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
# libudev-dev is so yo may launch Google Chrome from the browser.
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev
# xorg-dev is a PerlTk dependency. Without it, PerlTk will not install properly or in worse cases, not at all.
sudo apt-get install xorg-dev 

# For a 32 bit system. If Google chrome will not launch from the command line then you must install libudev-dev 
# as stated above then link the shared object libraries with the following command.
sudo ln -sf /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libudev.so.1 /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libudev.so.0

# SO linker command for a 64 bit system.
sudo ln -sf /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libudev.so.1 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libudev.so.0 

# If you receive this error 
# Please check the validity of the index file by comparing it to more
# than one CPAN mirror. I'll continue but problems seem likely to
# happen.

# The solution is to remove both
 /root/.cpan/sources/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz ( AND ) /root/.cpan/sources/modules/03modlist.data.gz
# and reload cpan. Then reinstall whatever module you were previously installing.

# Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "canberra-gtk-module" 
# The following command handles this error.
sudo apt-get install libcanberra-gtk-module:i386

#-----------------------------------------------------USAGE----------------------------------------------------#

# Using PhotoStream is easy. Once it is launched, you simply click on the "Get Code" button. This will open up a  
# new tab in yor browser and will reirect your addrss bar to a final URL with a query string inside. You must copy 
# the access token, everything after code= is what we need. Copy and paste this access code into PhotoStreams Text 
# Entry widget and click the "Download" button. PhotoStream will take care of the rest. Enjoy.
